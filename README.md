CS 262 - Lab #1
This lab is based on these [lab materials](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/01introduction/lab.html).

Hacks that I had to make: Set up the expo go and connect it to my phone, the QR code didn't want to show up, but I used link to make it work, codes were simple, hello world.

Answers to the lab questions: This is a really cool hello world app, it says "hello world."
